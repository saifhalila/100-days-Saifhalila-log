### R1D1 
Today I've started the Wherefore art thou challenge from @freeCodeCamp . Worked on Object and its property and value pairs,first I struggled for 5 hours,but in the end I solved it.

### R1D2 
the Search and Replace is a challenge from @freeCodeCamp.It is about perform a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and return the new sentence.but the tricky thing is if you mean to replace the word,such as  "Book" with the word "dog", it should be replaced as "Dog".It took me 2 hours.

### R1D3 
Pig Latin is a challenge from @freeCodeCamp.It is Translate the provided string to pig Latin.Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay".If a word begins with a vowel you just add "way" to the end.
